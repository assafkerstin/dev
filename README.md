# dev

This is the dev repository on github. A public depository, meant for keeping my newly development material as I learn new programming skills.
The first step is to learn how tpo integrate Visual Studio Code witgh github, as well as integrating it with GreenGeeks web hosting.

A dev repository was created on GitHub. URL is: https://github.com/assafkerstin/dev.git

Then I integrated it with GreenGeeks. Then, I installed the Visual Studio Code GitHub extension.

Initially the repository only included a README file, this file. I have successfully cloned the repository from GitHub from within Visual Studio Code,
so now I am updating the README file with Visual Studio Code.

I will then understand how to commit it to github through visual studio code, and then see how I can have the GreenGeeks websosting update the visual studio code directly from the github.

Visual Studio Code ---> GitHub --> Greengeeks.

Local repository folder is at my dropbox (dev folder)

In Visual Studio Code: View->Source Control. The GitHub extension opens. I have an M symbol next to the readme file showing me that the file has been midified.
